DigiDice is a random number generator that simulates a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 sided die.  There are six buttons, each corresponding to one of these dice, and pressing one of these buttons will generate a true random number within the selected die's range.  That number is then shown on a 2 digit 7 segment display.
